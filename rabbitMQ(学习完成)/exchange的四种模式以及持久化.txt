Exchanges are AMQP entities where messages are sent. Exchanges take a message and route it into zero or more queues. The routing algorithm used depends on the exchange type and rules called bindings. AMQP 0-9-1 brokers provide four exchange types:

Name    Default pre-declared names

Direct exchange (Empty string) and amq.direct
Fanout exchange amq.fanout
Topic exchange  amq.topic
Headers exchange    amq.match (and amq.headers in RabbitMQ)


可以看到空值默认就是direct


所谓的持久化,就是发送端把数据传给queue以前,先把数据在本地保存下来,这样即使宕机了,数据已经在硬盘里面了就不用担心了.
